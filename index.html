              <p id="one">What is a dream Destination?
                  <br> It is the desire of getting to a destination and your need to accomplish or obtain it.

              <p class="para">I have visited many places around the world like Thailand, Italy, Rome, France etc... I am very fortunate 
                  <br> that I got to visit my dream destination in the summer of 2017 in a family trip to europe.
                  <br>Switzerland was very beautiful... I remember sitting in the train admirmiring the beauty of the green landscape 
                  <br>in front of me. I just loved it, it was also the very first time I had seen snow so it was very special for me.
                  <br> I think Switzerland was my mom and dad's dream destination as well... we had a lot of fun there, this sounded like
                  <br> a perfect vacation but due to the cold me and my mom got fever... but we recovered soon and that didn't stop us
                  <br> from having an amazing time together. This was my dream destination.
